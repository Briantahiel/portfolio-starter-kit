## Markdown and MDX.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML. It is commonly used for writing content on websites and blogs. 

Input:

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Output:

<p>I <strong>love</strong> using <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a></p>

MDX is a superset of Markdown that allows you to write JSX directly in your Markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and incorporate React components within your content.

Next.js can support both local MDX content within your application and remote MDX files dynamically fetched on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming Markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in server components (the default in App Router).

### Dependency Installation
The @next/mdx package and related packages are used to set up Next.js to process Markdown and MDX. It retrieves data from local files, allowing you to create pages with a .md or .mdx extension directly in your /pages or /app directory.

Install these packages to render MDX with Next.js:

    npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx

### Configuring next.config.mjs
Update the next.config.mjs file in your project path to configure it to use MDX:

```jsx
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

This allows .md and .mdx files to act as pages, routes, or imports in your application.
